# Salva CPR Project
## Problem
Cessation of blood flow to the brain and thus death of the patient due to the death of brain cells due to many cases such as heart attack , stroke and other nervous system disorder , near drowning. Risk of rib fracture if CPR is done inaccurately The no chest compression intervals were related to human error Manual chest compression is limited by many factors such as the environment, the mental and physical strength of the rescuer and it will be affected by fatigue of the rescue.

## Solution
Our project will be a portable chest compressor that provides automatic chest compression and decompression CPR aimed to eliminate the problems of manual chest compression by:
1. Providing appropriate ventilation to pump oxygenated blood to the brain through a ventilation circuit integratedinto the device
2. Keeping the stabilization by setting parameters, such as compression time, ratio, rate, count, number of pauses and depth
3. High safety due the characteristics developed in our projects that eliminate ribs fracture
